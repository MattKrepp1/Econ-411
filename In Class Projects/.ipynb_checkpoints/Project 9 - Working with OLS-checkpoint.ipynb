    "Having built statistics functions, we are now ready to build a function for regression analysis. We will start by building the an regression. We will use linear algebra to estimate parameters that minimize the sum of the squared errors. This is an ordinary least squares regression. \n",

    "An OLS regression with one exogenous variable takes the form. \n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\alpha + \\beta_1x_1 + \\mu $\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_0 = \\alpha + \\mu$\n",
    "\n",
    "We merge the error term, which represents bias in the data, with alpha to yield the constant, $\\beta_0$. This is necessary since OLS assumes an unbiased estimator where:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to form a prediction where, on average, the right-hand side of the equation  yields the correct value on the left-hand side. When we perform an OLS regression, we form a predictor that minimizes the sum of the distance between each predicted value and the observed value drawn from the data. For example, if the prediction for a particular value of y is 8, and the actual value is 10, the error of the prediction is -2 and the squared error is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the function that minimizes the sum squared errors, we will use matrix algebra, also known as linear algebra. For those unfamiliar, the next section uses the numpy library to perform matrix operations. For clarity, we will review the linear algebra functions that we will use with simple examples.\n",

    "In reviewing the linear equation for estimating $\\beta$, we confront two unique operations worth understanding. Included in these are some key concepts in linear algebra, including the identity matrix $I$ and linear independence. The best way to understand these concepts is by working with some sample vectors. Consider the matrix $X$ consisting of vectors $x_0$,$x_1$,â€¦,$x_{n-1}$,$x_n$. We must check that these vectors are linearly independent. We do this by joining $X$ with an identity matrix and thus create:\n",
