#For all questions, type the code below the quesiont. Clearly print results 
#that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

#1. Record your name in an object (x = ...) and a description of yourself in 
# another object. 

#2. Raise 2 to the 4th power. Save the value as an object named twoToTheFourth. 
# Then create a new value that sums the value twice. Create another variable that 
# saves the value of twoToTheFourth as a string. Just as with the numeric value, 
# sum the string object twice.

#3. Find the list of escape sequences in section 2.4:
#    https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
# create a string that uses at least 4 different escape sequences.
    
#4. Add an integer and a float together. Is the final number an integer or a float?

#5. Add 2 ** 1024 + 1.5. What is the outcome? Why? hint: Try adding .5, 1, and 
# 1.1 instead of 1.5.

#6. import the string library with the script "import string". Print 
# string.__dict__ . What is the output? If you do not understand the meaning,
# search "python class __dict__" and find an explanation.

#7. Call at least 5 of the results from string.__dict__.

#8. Concatenate 3 distinct strings

#9. In a single line, create a print function that prints a string across 3 
# lines. hint: you will use an escape sequences
