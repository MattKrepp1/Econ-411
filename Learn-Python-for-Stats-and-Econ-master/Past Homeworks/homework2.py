#For all questions, type the code below the quesiont. Clearly print results 
#that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

#1. Create a list of numbers at least 100 elements in length that counts by
# 3s - i.e., [3,6,9,12,...]

#2. Using the list from question 1, create a second list whose elements are
# the same values converted to strings. hint: use str()

#3 Using the list from question 2, create a variable that concatenates each of 
# the elements in order of index. hint: result sould be like "36912..."

#4 Using .pop() and .append(), create a list whose values are the same 
# as the list from question 1 but in reverse order

#5 Using a slice and len(), create a list that includes only the second half
# of the list from question 1

#6 Create a string that includes only every other element, starting from the 0th element,
# from the string in question 3 while maintaining the order of these elements
# Hint: this can be done be using a for loop whose values are descending

#7. Explain the difference between a dynamic list in Python (usually referred
# to as a list) and an array.

# Graduate Student Questions
# 1. Use a generator to create a list of the first 1000 prime numbers. Include
# a paragraph explaining how a generator works

#2. Using a for loop and the pop function, create a list of the values from the 
# list of prime numbers whose values are descending from highest to lowest

#3. Using either of prime numbers, create another list that includes the same 
# numbers but is randomly ordered. Do this without shuffling the initial list
# hint: you will need to import random and import copy. Explain in a paragraph
# the process that you followed to accomplish the task
