#1.	Run an OLS regression using a different set of data. Use the regression 
#class created in this chapter. Print the results.

#2.	Create scatter plots of the observation and predicted values as demonstrated at the end of this chapter.

#3.	Use the numpy libraries log function to log some or all value in your data. 
#Print the columns of data that have been logged. (hint: pass the appropriate 
#list of keys to the dataframe, data[[key1,key2,key3…]])

#4.	Run the same regression again. Print the results. How has the significance 
#changed?

#5.	Plot the new results using scatter plots as in question 2.

#6.	Create 2 unique visualizations of the results using matplotlib 
#(e.g., time series predicted values and observations, plots with more than 
#2 variables represented such as 3D plane or changing size of dots, a plot 
#comparing results of the logged and unlogged regression, etc…). For 
#visualization ideas see: https://matplotlib.org/examples/.
