For all questions, type the code below the quesion. Clearly print results 
that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

1. Create a function that calculates the length of a list without using len()
 and returns this value. Create a list and pass it to the function to find its 
 length.

2. Create a function that performs dot multiplication on two vectors (lists), 
 such that if list1 = [x1,x2,x3] and list2 = [y1,y2,y3], 
 dot_product_list1_list2 = [x1y1, x2y2, x3y3] and returns this list. 
Pass two lists of the same length to this function.

3. In a single line, pass two lists of the same length to the function from
 question 2 and pass the instance of that function to the function from 
 question 1. What is the length of dot_product_list1_list2?

4. Create two unique lists using generator functions and pass them to the
 function created in question 2.

5. Create a function that checks the types of elements in a list. For example,
 if a list contains a string, an integer, and a float, this function should 
 return a list that contains identifies these three types: [str, int, float]

6. In a single line, pass a list with at least 4 different types to the function 
 from question 5 and pass the result to the funciton measuring length. 

7. Create a class that houses each of the functions (now methods) that you have created. 
 Create an instance of that class and use each of the methods from the class.
