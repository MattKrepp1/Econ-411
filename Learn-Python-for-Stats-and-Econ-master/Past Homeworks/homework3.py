#For all questions, type the code below the quesion. Clearly print results 
#that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

#1. Create a list of random numbers between 0 and 100 whose length is 1000. 
# Hint: import random; search "python random" to learn more about the library

#2. Use the variance function from the textbook to find the variance of this list.
# Assume that the list represent a population in whole. 

#3. Create a 9 more lists of the same length whose elements are random numbers 
# between 0 and 100. Use a nested dictionary to house and identify these lists. 
# Keys for the first layer should be the numbers 1 through 10. Lists should be
# stored using a second key as follows: dict_name[index]["list"]. Index represents
# the particular integer key between 1 and 10 as noted above.

#4. Find the variance of each list and store it as follows:
# dict_name[index]["variance"].

#5. At the end of chapter 2, we used for loops to find min and max values. 
# create a min() function and max() function and pass the values from the list
# in question 1 to each of these to determine the min and max values in that 
# list.

#6. Explain why it might be advantageous to create a function instead of 
# building all commands from scratch as you create a script.

#Graduate Student Questions
#1. Visit the Python Essentials lesson from Sargent and Stachurski. Complete 
# exercise 3. Pass 3 other sentences to the function that you create. 
#Include a paragraph that explains in detail how the function operates

#2. Visit the Python Essentials lesson from Sargent and Stachurski. Complete 
# exercise 4. Pass 3 pairs of unique lists to the function. Include a paragraph
# explaining in detail how the function operates, including explanation for a 
# solution that uses set()
