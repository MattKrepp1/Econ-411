#For all questions, type the code below the quesiont. Clearly print results 
#that evidences that your code performs the assigned task.

#1. Create an array with (100) elements using np.arange()

#2. Create two numpy arrays whose values are neither all 0 or 1. Multiply
# the two arrays and save the result i.e., result = array1 * array2

#3. Create a dictionary where each key points to a unique numpy array. All 
# arrays should be of the same length. Then transform that dictionary into a pandas dataframe.

#4. Import a data set for your project in pandas. You may use whatever means 
# you prefer to import the data. Print the dataframe.

#5 Create a new column of data derived from the data that you have already 
# imported. hint: this may be a ratio or whatever transformation that you
# think would be useful...

#6. Use a for loop to print individually each column in the dataframe.

#7. Create a function that plots 2 to 3 different variables from the dataframe.
# the function may look something like "def plot_data(df,names, etc...). Each
# plot should include a legend and title.

#8 Create a bar graph plot using the data you have imported.

#9 On any of the graphs you have created, change the font size, axis labels, 
# tick labels, color, linewidth, and so forth. Make it look very nice This 
# will be graded for asthetic appeal.
